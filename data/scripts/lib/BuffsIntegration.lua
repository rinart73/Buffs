--[[ This file can be used to define descriptions for buff types. Why?
  * To reduce network load (just a bit)
  * To remove the need to repeat them multiple time
  * To allow other mods/server owners to override your buff descriptions
Example:
descriptions["Dusty Sector"] = "High concentration of dust particles prevents\nyour ship sensors from functioning properly.\nWait until sensor recalibration is finished."%_t
descriptions["Beginner's Blessing"] = "Luck is on your side in these first steps on the expanses of space.\nWelcome to '${server}'!"%_t
]]

local descriptions = {}

return descriptions
